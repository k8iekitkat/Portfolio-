                Simply a passionate individual who loves 
                exploring creativity through various artistic hobbies like 
                traditional art, nail art, and crocheting. My dream job is to find a position where I can merge this creativity with my love for coding. I'm excited about opportunities that allow me to innovate 
                and bring imaginative ideas to life through technology.
